# Static Media Service v0.0.1a

This is a project I've been working on in an effort to create the simplest
way to be able to enjoy my personal media collection from multiple devices.

Currently, everything revolves around adding meta-information about the content
into separate json files, that each dictate how to display a page, as well as
the entries on that page. This offers great flexibility on how the system can
be organized overall, as well as the amount of content that can be managed through
one interface.

The plan is to automate the creating of these meta-files, much in the say
Kodi can automatically download banner images and information about the content
but this will require additional experimentation.
